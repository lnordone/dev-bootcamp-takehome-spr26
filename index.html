        <!-- <h1>Lucas Nordone</h1> -->
        <p class="text-card"> Hi! I'm Lucas Nordone, a second-year computer engineering student at Geogia Tech. I am originally from Raleigh, NC but I have loved my time in Atlanta and all of the new experiences that being here at GT has provided me. 
            <br>
            <br>
            A central part of my life is nature and the outdoors. I grew up with parents who loved to hike and camp, who constantly had at least a few dogs around the house, and who imparted in me an appreciation for the natural world and the environment. As I've grown the way I have interacted with the world has changed, I am a new vegetarian (only about 6 months in), I have started to get into rock climbing and bouldering, and I have been working with a startup that tries to accelerate enviornment research using AI. I am hoping to continue to positively impact the world and keep sustainability a focus in my life.
